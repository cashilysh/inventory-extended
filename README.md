# Inventory Extended

The default Minecraft inventory was designed when the game had far fewer items. Nowadays, it feels restrictive as it's quickly filling up with junk and making inventory management a hassle.

Shulker boxes and bundles aren’t practical alternatives—they require constant placement, breaking, and micromanagement, disrupting the flow rather than improving it.

**Features:**
- Expands the inventory slots in a vanilla way
- The extended inventory is usable in all in-game inventory screens
- Works seamlessly with the `KeepInventory` game rule

<br>

**Notes:**
- Vanilla `offHand` and `equipment` slot mappings are modified and may break mod-compatibility
- Creative Inventory is still buggy and returns glitched items
- Quick-SHIFT-Click sort may be glitchy and not sort to the expanded slots
- Currently only Client compatibility

**This is a WIP version and may contain other bugs and glitches! Use at your own risk!**
